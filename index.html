			<p class="paragraph">Still We Remain 
			thousands will fall
			ten thousands shall pass away at my side
			all worlds collapse
			but still we remain</p>
		
			<p class="paragraph">glory
			to the living God
			praises be to the eternal one
			who upholds me with His righteous hands
			destroy the evil in me
			pound it to dust
			pour it out as my blood in the streets
			these are my enemies</p>

			<p class="paragraph">multitudes
			in the valley of decision
			decide this day whom you shall serve
			if the darkness alive
			follow
			if God be God
			decide
			in the valley of decision
			the blood will flow more freely than rain
			grace and redemption
			or drown with the dead</p>
